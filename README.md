# reddit_stock_sentiment
This project scans reddit and reports the most commonly mentioned stock tickers in comments and posts. Then sentiment analysis is performed, and the final results is a list of the top tickers, the amount of times they appear, and their average sentiment.

For the sentiment model, I used a BERT model with 6 LSTM layers and two linears layers on top of it. The model was trained using the data here: https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140. This dataset contains tweets with a positive or negative sentiment. Using this dataset, the model has a testing accuracy of 86% from training for 6 epochs. This is a huge model, and it was hard to optmize it, as I do not have a great laptop. I might not be using the best model architecture, but this is the best time vs perforamce archtieture I found.
